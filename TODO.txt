- find globbing of given DIR(s), cat globbing, zcat globbing, open globbing: client.glob()
- job:
  - keys via 'find $args -type o'
- mantash job -c JOB-ID   # cancel a job
- mantash job: taking keys on stdin
- job support for running a given *script*
- test suite:
  - moar
  - python version compat (add Python 3 classifiers), clarify supported
    python verions
  - OS compat tests
- unicode data tests: and filenames too

# Bugs

- find:
    $ mbeta find . -ls       # fails
    mantash: ERROR: /trentm/stor: no such remote directory
    $ mbeta find tmp -ls     # works
    directory  trentm           -                            tmp
    ...
- job:
    [trentm@manta-beta /trentm/stor]$ job tmp ^ zonename
    mantash: ERROR: global name 'pname' is not defined (/Users/trentm/joy/python-manta/bin/mantash:1158 in do_job)

# Someday/Maybe

- mantash less
- mantash touch
- mantash rmdir
- mantash md5  # a la mmd5
- mantash job ARGS:  where 'ARGS' is like 'find -type o', i.e. recursive
  and just objects
- mantash diff   # that does the fast thing for binary files (use md5 compare)
- mantash sync  # like rsync, but less complicated
  Use case: sync the latest changes from a *git repo* in manta, then run
  a job on it.
- pipe support in interactive shell to *local* commands
- import mantash TODOs
- mantash job ^C support
- mantash job -W   or something to NOT wait for a job to complete
- retries
- Cache the Authorization header for the same Date second. Bryan has been
  able to get ECONNREFUSED using the ssh-agent. Also keep a persistent
  conn to ssh-agent?
- 'datetime=True' option to list_directory to interp the mtime to datetime
  objects
- pip/python setup.py install support (hack-i-berry). All deps should be in
  a lib/manta/deps which gets added to sys.path for manta imports
- remember visited public folders for tab completion and 'mantash ls /'
  Need an option to drop that cache.
- Unix-y MantaClient subclass with: mkdir, mkdirp, rmr, etc. a la node-manta.
  - ls should use marker and result-set-size
- streaming MantaClient.list_directory(), put_object(), get_object()
  See https://github.com/madlag/streaming_httplib2
- extra utility endpoints like node-manta's client.info() and others?

# Wanted from Manta

- include content-type for files in dirents. would be handy for 'ls -l'.
  Also include size/content-length -- useful for Apache/Nginx-style dir
  listings.

# Manta bug to report

- this:
    [https://manta-beta.joyentcloud.com/trentm/public/python-manta]$ ln python-manta-1.0.0.tgz python-manta-latest.tgz
    mantash: ERROR: (AuthorizationFailed) trentm is not allowed to access /trentm/public/python-manta/python-manta-1.0.0.tgz (/Users/trentm/joy/python-manta/lib/manta/client.py:398 in put_link)
