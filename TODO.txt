# todo

- jobs endpoints
- re-instate all of mantash:
  - mantash commands:
      - ls
- package build and install notes for installing from tarball
- auth.cliSigner -- have all the pieces there
- Cache the Authorization header for the same Date second. Bryan has been
  able to get ECONNREFUSED using the ssh-agent. Also keep a persistent
  conn to ssh-agent?
- 'datetime=True' option to list_directory to interp the mtime to datetime
  objects
- retries
- import mantash TODOs

# Someday/Maybe

- mantash jobs (note 'mjobs -s running' to show active jobs)
- remember visited public folders for tab completion and 'mantash ls /'
  Need an option to drop that cache.
- Unix-y MantaClient subclass with: mkdir, mkdirp, rmr, etc. a la node-manta.
  - ls should use marker and result-set-size
- streaming MantaClient.list_directory(), put_object(), get_object()
  See https://github.com/madlag/streaming_httplib2
- extra utility endpoints like node-manta's client.info() and others?
