# Someday/Maybe

- mantash job ARGS:  where 'ARGS' is like 'find -type o', i.e. recursive
  and just objects
- mantash lcd, lls
- mantash diff   # that does the fast thing for binary files (use md5 compare)
- mantash sync  # like rsync, but less complicated
  Use case: sync the latest changes from a *git repo* in manta, then run
  a job on it.
- pipe support in interactive shell to *local* commands
- import mantash TODOs
- mantash job ^C support
- mantash job -W   or something to NOT wait for a job to complete
- retries
- auth.cliSigner -- have all the pieces there
- Cache the Authorization header for the same Date second. Bryan has been
  able to get ECONNREFUSED using the ssh-agent. Also keep a persistent
  conn to ssh-agent?
- 'datetime=True' option to list_directory to interp the mtime to datetime
  objects
- mantash jobs (note 'mjobs -s running' to show active jobs)
- remember visited public folders for tab completion and 'mantash ls /'
  Need an option to drop that cache.
- Unix-y MantaClient subclass with: mkdir, mkdirp, rmr, etc. a la node-manta.
  - ls should use marker and result-set-size
- streaming MantaClient.list_directory(), put_object(), get_object()
  See https://github.com/madlag/streaming_httplib2
- extra utility endpoints like node-manta's client.info() and others?

# Wanted from Manta

- include content-type for files in dirents. would be handy for 'ls -l'.
  Also include size/content-length -- useful for Apache/Nginx-style dir
  listings.

# Manta bug to report

- this:
    [https://manta-beta.joyentcloud.com/trentm/public/python-manta]$ ln python-manta-1.0.0.tgz python-manta-latest.tgz
    mantash: ERROR: (AuthorizationFailed) trentm is not allowed to access /trentm/public/python-manta/python-manta-1.0.0.tgz (/Users/trentm/joy/python-manta/lib/manta/client.py:398 in put_link)
